# Day-Dashboard - Group Project 1!

Hi and welcome to our README for the first group project! This proposal outlines a day dashboard that users can visit to get an overview of their time, whether it be their day, week or month. Users can write in checklists of tasks or items to buy, check them off, gain some motivation from a random quote, and see a calendar that has holidays blocked off based on their region. Users can interact with cute elements including selecting their daily mood, write down their thoughts etc all in a calming visually pleasing application. The color and mood of the application changes based on time of day (sunrise, sunset)

Motivation
The motivation for this application is to provide users a place to write down their to-do lists that is aesthetic and satisfying to promote motivation and productivity.


## User Story

```md

SO THAT I can proceed with ease and reward myself along the way
```
